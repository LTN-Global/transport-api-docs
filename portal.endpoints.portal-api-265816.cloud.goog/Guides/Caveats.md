# WARNINGS

The documentation here has auto-converted all field names to use CamelCase for both gRPC and REST whereas the actual API uses snake_case. 
This is a known limitation of Google's web docs tool.  Therefore, unfortunately, you must convert all CamelCase specifications back to 
snake_case in your head.

The REST documentation also lists incorrect URLs.  In particular, the listed hostname is not the actual API's hostname.  Please contact 
someone on the transport division's development team to get the correct hostname and port.
