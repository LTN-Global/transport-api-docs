# Caveats

The documentation here has auto-converted all field names to use CamelCase for both gRPC and REST whereas the actual API uses snake_case. 
This is a known limitation of Google's web docs tool.  Therefore, unfortunately, you must convert all CamelCase specifications back to 
snake_case in your head.
